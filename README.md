## Overview

`questionnaire` is a R package with questions about R programming language. 


## Proposed functonality
- should have `start_quiz()` which will render a quiz on a localhost using shiny framework
- `start_quiz()` should allow how many questions should be there in the quiz. Default can be 5
- For reference, see: [LearnR](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package.
- For starters, the package will come with default set of questions. The quiz will be created by selecting questions from this default set at random.
- The package should have a template that will allow users to submit questions with pull requests
- A workflow to automatically integrate user submitted questions into the package
